Installing EGachine

======================================================================

Installing a binary package:
(recommended for beginners)

----------------------------------------------------------------------

win32:
download the zip archive extract it and read the README file

----------------------------------------------------------------------

debian/gnu linux: 

add following line to /etc/apt/sources.list:

deb http://egachine.berlios.de/debian testing main

Then as root:

$apt-get update && apt-get install egachine

After  installation  there are  epong and morse-scooter  in the arcade
game menu.

Building EGachine

----------------------------------------------------------------------

debian/gnu linux:

add following line to /etc/apt/sources.list:

deb-src http://egachine.berlios.de/debian testing main

read:
http://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/apt-howto/ch-sourcehandling.en.html

for example:

As root:
# update package database
$apt-get update
# install packages required to build egachine
$apt-get build-dep egachine
# install fakeroot
$apt-get install fakeroot

As normal user
# fetch source
$apt-get source egachine
# build package
$cd egachine-0.0.?
$dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot -b -uc

----------------------------------------------------------------------

generic build instructions:

Currently there is no Makefile,  and we currently don't use  autoutils
(no autoconf/make). There are only some bash scripts (someone wants to
make   them   sh-scripts?)   Usage  of    ccache  or compilercache  is
recommended.

Build Dependencies: 

(All these should be avaiable as -dev packages for your favorite linux
distribution)

- SDL <http://www.libsdl.org>
- SDL_image <http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/>
- libsigc++-1.2
- OpenGL/Mesa
- c++ compiler (f.e. g++ - probably version >=3)

If you checked out from CVS you also need:
- spidermonkey which is not in CVS but in the source tarball.
- SDL_mixer which is not in CVS but in the source tarball.

For regenerating OpenGL wrappers (normally not needed):
perl,sed,grep,indent,bash,?

take a look at ./make - perhaps you have to edit something?

supported environment variables (see also common.sh):
CC, CXX, CXXFLAGS, PREFIX, BINDIR, DATADIR, DOCDIR, SYSCONFDIR

run (in the top level source directory):
$./make

you don't have to install but can do so with:
$./install

building for win32 platforms:
at the moment a native build is not supported - the win32 binaries
are cross-compiled with mingw from linux
