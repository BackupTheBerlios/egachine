		EGachine <http://egachine.berlios.de>

is an open source  (GPL)  ECMAScript (JavaScript) game  machine/engine
using mozilla's JavaScript engine,  Spidermonkey.  Though the focus is
on 2D multi-player (networked)  games, EGachine isn't limited to games
at all.  You can think of  EGachine as a programmable OpenGL terminal,
which could be used in various ways - for example as presentation tool
or movie player similar to Flash, for teaching and learning OpenGL, as
special purpose terminal,...  .   Technically speaking  EGachine  is a
JavaScript interpreter with bindings for subsets of: OpenGL/MESA, SDL,
SDL_mixer, SDL_image and ZLib.

Perhaps a better name would have been pglTerm (for programmable opengl
terminal) but then  again this would suggest it  is somehow related to
xterm and other terminal emulation programs.

  THIS SOFTWARE COMES WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY PERHAPS IT DESTROYS YOUR

		       FOR DETAILS SEE COPYING

THIS IS WORK IN PROGRESS (ALPHA) THE SERVER AND CLIENT ARE INSECURE !

    For now you should treat scripts like binaries and take care!

----------------------------------------------------------------------

QUICK-START

Input / controls:
if you have a joystick, it acts like a gamepad
no joystick/gamepad => keyboard acts like a gamepad

Keyboard controls:

Key		Function		Comments

ESC		quit
Alt+Enter	toggle fullscreen	(not supported on win32)
Ctrl+Z		iconify window		(not supported on win32?)

Keypad 1:
cursor keys _on the number block_
buttons: 0 and . (, on german keyboards)

Keypad 2:
w,a,s,d
buttons: 1 and 2

For best results please make sure your video driver synchronizes page
flips to the vertical retrace of your monitor.

(if you use linux and nvidia drivers:
export __GL_SYNC_TO_VBLANK=1
with version 1.0-5336 it seems to works well
older versions used a busy loop)

Windows:
All .bat files should do something.

To run a local 2-player pong game start:
pong.bat

To run a networked 2-player pong game:
first start
netpong.bat (this starts the server)
then
client.bat (this starts the client)

Linux users:
USAGE: egachine script

FEATURES/GOALS:

- open source / free software (GPL)

- not limited to games - could also be used as:
  presentation tool, "movie" player similar to flash, special purpose
  terminal, tool to teach/learn OpenGL

- beginner friendly:
  Get  beginners started with  game  programing. For  now  there is no
  detailed documentation (any volunteers?) but the examples should get
  you started.  JavaScript is a nice  language  and you don't  need to
  compile  code.  You only  need  EGachine and  a   text editor to get
  started.

- audio support:
  Currently the audio API is very basic but simple:
  you can play music and samples. In the future there probably will be
  OpenAL bindings.

- optional OpenGL <http://www.opengl.org> support:
  for the advanced programmer or OpenGL teaching - OpenGL language 
  bindings are included. The API is close to the C API. Instead of 
  glBegin write gl.Begin and glGet(3x) functions return an array.

- quick development of games
  sometimes you just want to write a game within few hours

- portability

- Run untrusted code in a secure manner:
  This is similar to Java applets or like browsers run JavaScript 
  code. This means you only download the client once and games/apps
  may be shipped via network. Neither server nor client can access 
  files from JavaScript code.

- network support:
  Writing multi-player network games/apps should be easy.
  The client may establish one connection to a server. The server may 
  listen on one port and establish one connection (for example to a 
  meta-server).

----------------------------------------------------------------------

ROADMAP:

1.0.0 (January 2005):
	- feature complete stable API with documentation
	- SVG support

----------------------------------------------------------------------

HELP WANTED:

if you like EGachine please contact me/us. For now mail me directly:
karme@berlios.de

Could someone write a small GUI in JavaScript?
(Menu, checkboxes, themable, suitable for games)

Perhaps a game generator frontend which produces suitable output for
egaserver/egachine ?

As you probably noticed I am  no native English  speaker and for me it
is quite  difficult to write texts and  documentation. Perhaps you are
a good writer?
