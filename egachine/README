EGachine (http://egachine.berlios.de)
is an open source (GPL) ECMA Script (Javascript) game machine/engine 
based on jgachine <http://jgachine.berlios.de>
which was dropped in favor of egachine.[1]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
WARNING:
THIS SOFTWARE COMES WITHOUT ANY WARRENTY 
- PERHAPS IT DESTROYS YOUR COMPUTER
FOR DETAILS SEE COPYING

this is work in progress (pre-alpha)
the server is insecure !!
and the client perhaps, too
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

FEATURES/GOALS:
- run untrusted code in a secure manner:
  this is similar to java applets or like browsers run javascript code.
  This means you only download the client once and games/apps
  may be shipped via network
- network support:
  writing multiplayer network games/apps should be easy
- beginner friendly:
  get beginners started with game programing
- optional OpenGL support:
  for the advanced programer or OpenGL teaching - OpenGL language bindings are
  included
- quick development of games
  sometimes you just want to write a game within few hours
- portability
- not limited to games - could also be used as:
	presentation tool
	"movie" player similar to flash
	...

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

HELP WANTED:
if you like EGachine please contact me/us. For now mail me directly:
karme@berlios.de

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

QUICKSTART (windows)
All .bat files should do something.

To run a local 2-player pong game start:
pong.bat

To run a networked 2-player pong game:
first start
netpong.bat (this starts the server)
then
client.bat (this starts the client)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Compilation from source:
currently no Makefile, no autoutils (no autoconf/make)
only a bash script (someone wants to make it a sh-script?)

Dependencies:
SDL
SDL_image
OpenGL/Mesa
c++ (f.e. gcc - probably version >=3)

For regenerating OpenGL wrappers (normally not needed):
perl


take a look at ./make - perhaps you have to edit something?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[1] why was jgachine dropped in favor of egachine?
- javascript is easier for beginners than java
- no need to compile the code
- java serialization was too slow
- gcc / gcj / libgcj java security is not yet ready
