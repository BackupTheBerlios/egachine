		EGachine <http://egachine.berlios.de>

is  an JavaScript game  engine focused  on 2D multi-player (networked)
games. The idea is to provide a  tool for learning by writing computer
games.   EGachine is based upon a   simple extensible JavaScript shell
(EJS) and  includes different modules providing functionality required
for programing games.

		  EJS (extensible JavaScript shell)

is a  simple minimalistic (currently non-interactive) JavaScript shell
utilizing mozilla's  JavaScript interpreter SpiderMonkey.  The purpose
of EJS is to get a JavaScript shell which is  extensible in the spirit
of other interpreters like Perl  and Python.  The module framework  is
kept as simple as possible  to encourage code-reuse among people using
the SpiderMonkey API directly, even if they don't use EJS.

    For now you should treat scripts like binaries and take care!

QUICK-START

Input / controls:

General:

Key		Function		Comments

ESC		quit
Alt+Enter	toggle fullscreen	(not supported on win32)


Gamepads:

If you have (a) joystick(s), they act like gamepads.
Joysticks/Gamepads are prefered but are emulated by keyboard
if not available.

Keypad 1:
cursor keys on the number block
buttons: 0 and . (, on german keyboards)

Keypad 2:
w,a,s,d
buttons: 1 and 2

Keypad 3:
cursor keys
buttons: right alt and right meta

NOTE:

For best results please make sure your video driver synchronizes page
flips to the vertical retrace of your monitor.


RUNNING:

Windows:
All .bat files should do something.

Linux/Unix users:
USAGE: egachine script

----------------------------------------------------------------------

For compilation instructions / installation procedure see INSTALL

----------------------------------------------------------------------

FEATURES/GOALS:

- open source / free software (GPL)

- tool for learning by writing computer games

- beginner friendly:
  Get  beginners started with  game  programing. For  now  there is no
  detailed documentation (any volunteers?) but the examples should get
  you started.  JavaScript is a nice  language  and you don't  need to
  compile  code.  You only  need  EGachine and  a   text editor to get
  started.

- quick development of games
  sometimes you just want to write a game within few hours

- portability

- run untrusted code in a secure manner:
  This is similar to Java applets or like browsers run JavaScript 
  code. This means you only download the client once and games/apps
  may be shipped via network. Neither server nor client can access 
  files from JavaScript code. (ATTENTION: at the moment you should
  not run untrusted scripts)

- network support:
  Writing multi-player network games/apps should be easy.
  The client may establish one connection to a server. The server may 
  listen on one port and establish one connection (for example to a 
  meta-server).

- not limited to games - could also be used as:
  presentation tool, "movie" player similar to flash, special purpose
  terminal, tool to teach/learn OpenGL

- modular:
  based upon EJS and modules for EJS

  Video modules:
  - OpenGL language bindings
  - Video layer (basic 2D functionality)
  - a simple scene-graph
  - experimental SVG module

  Audio module:
  - very basic functionality
  - play music
  - play samples

  Input module:
  For beginners:
  - gamepad like input devices (perhaps emulated by keyboard)
  - or text input
  For advanced users:
  - events for:
    keyboard, mouse, joystick, window manager, ...

  Network Module:
  - basic stream interface (read/write)
  - distributed object graph

Sphere <http://sphere.sourceforge.net/>:
  License: GPL
  Description: "Ever had that perfect plot idea for  an RPG but didn't
  have the programming knowledge to create it? Enter Sphere. Sphere is
  a   console-style RPG engine  that allows   others  to create an RPG
  similar to Final Fantasy, Dragon Quest, or Phantasy Star."

JiggleScript <http://www.jigglescript.com/>:
  License: ?
  Description: "JiggleScript is a development enviroment that combines
  the well-known web programming  language JavaScript with OpenGL, the
  standard graphics API used in  modern 3D games. The target  audience
  are those that may be familar  with JavaScript already from building
  web pages and  would like to try  their hand at something that might
  be a little more  fun  without needing to  learn C  or C++ or  other
  "bigger" languages."

Pygame <http://www.pygame.org/>: 
  License: LGPL
  Description: "Pygame is a set of Python modules designed for writing
  games.  It is written  on  top of the   excellent SDL library.  This
  allows you to create fully featured games and multimedia programs in
  the python  language. Pygame is highly portable  and runs  on nearly
  every platform and operating system."


Projects also embedding SpiderMonkey (similar to EJS):

JSDB  <http://www.jsdb.org/>:
  "is a JavaScript shell  designed with network-centric programming in
  mind.  It can  be used as  a database interface,  XML processor, and
  internet-oriented scripting language. JSDB can  do nearly any  batch
  processing task that Visual Basic can do,  and it has drivers to let
  you read and send  email, query an  Oracle database, and run regular
  expression searches,  without having to  learn a specific SQL syntax
  or install a bunch of ActiveX components."
