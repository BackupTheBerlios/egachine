Notes for the gp2x game console (arm-gp2x-linux):
- ejs runs on the gp2x
- egachine not yet

ejs modules missing:
- network: needs sigc++ 1.0.x (cross compilation failed)
- video (at the moment there is only a opengl backend - see below)
- opengl: perhaps use a opengles implementation? (vincent?)
  or try osmesa (i hacked sdl at some time to use osmesa when using
  fbdev)
- tcc
