Extensible Javascript shell.

This is a minimalistic extensible non-interactive Javascript shell.

minimalistic:
	keep it small and simple

extensible:
	modules (Javascript or native code) can be loaded at runtime

non-interactive:
	it is not intended to be a command line interpreter with
	history and advanced editing functions (although it should be
	possible to write a module which provides that functionality)

Javascript:
	it uses mozilla's Javascript interpreter spidermonkey


Dependencies:
spidermonkey (jsapi.h header and library)


Debugging / leak checking (f.e. with valgrind):

export GLIBCPP_FORCE_NEW=1
export CXXFLAGS="-Wall -W -g -O0"
export LDFLAGS="-g"

valgrind is a great tool
--tool=massif is interesting, too
