Modules for the extensible Javascript shell.
The idea is to keep the module stuff as simple as possible. This should make
it easy for other projects using spidermonkey to use those modules, too.

Some notes for module writers:
Modules must be "self-contained" or to be more precise:
There mustn't be any undefined references at compile time. For details see [1].
To get started take a look at the example module.
The only header (of egachine / ejs) you are allowed to include is "ejsmodule.h".
At the moment no external symbols are defined in this header - this could change
and then a library would be created to hold them.


[1] http://www.belgeler.org/autobook/autobook-DLLs-with-Libtool.html: 

"All of the symbols required by a dll at runtime, must be resolved at
 link time. With some creative use of import libraries, it is usually
 possible to work around this shortcoming, but it is easy to forget
 this limitation if you are developing on a modern system which has
 lazy symbol resolution. Be sure to keep it at the back of your mind
 if you intend to have your package portable to Windows."
