javascript opengl language binding

NOTE:
there is no code to setup opengl
only the opengl functions are wrapped
opengl setup must be done seperately
(egachine opengl setup is done in video implementation
currently there is only one: sdlopengl
=> sdl is used to setup opengl)

NOTE:
perhaps not all egachine implementations will use/support opengl
first i did not want to wrap opengl because egachine should have a simple
API and should be simple to implement
on the other hand opengl is available on many platforms and has a nice API
(and now there is a stripped down version of opengl for the embedded space)

=> users can stick with the egachine API and it should be easy to implement
the video API on new platforms

or users can simply use the opengl stuff with its own benefits...

most of the code is autogenerated!
