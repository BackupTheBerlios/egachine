Audio module

Description:
Simple audio module allowing to play music and samples.

Security:
Depends on security of SDL_mixer and the libraries enabled and used by
SDL_mixer.

Module configuration options:
sdriver:      implementation to use
srate:        sampling rate
sbits:        sample precision
sbuffers:     output buffer size
stereo:       stereo?

Module dependencies:
None

Library dependencies:

At  the moment    there   is only   one    implementation.   It   uses
SDL_mixer.   SDL_mixer always depends  on libSDL.    Older versions of
SDL_mixer  ship  with a  modified  version  of libmikmod whereas newer
versions might   be linked  against an  external   libmikmod.  Current
EGachine distributions ship with a   statically linked CVS version  of
libSDL_mixer because  this   module  depends on   the   Mix_LoadMUS_RW
function only available in newer  versions.  Midi, ogg and mp3 support
are disabled in those builds.

Audio -> libSDL_mixer
libSDL_mixer -> libSDL
[libSDL_mixer -> libmikmod]
[libSDL_mixer -> libogg]
[libSDL_mixer -> libvorbis]
[libSDL_mixer -> libvorbisfile]
[libSDL_mixer -> libsmpeg]
