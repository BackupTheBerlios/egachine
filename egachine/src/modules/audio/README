Audio module

Description:
Simple audio module allowing to play music and samples.


Security:
Depends on security of SDL_mixer and the libraries enabled and used by
SDL_mixer.


Module dependencies:
None


Library dependencies:

The current implementation uses SDL_mixer. SDL_mixer always depends on
libSDL.  Older versions  ship with a  modified libmikmod whereas newer
versions   might  be linked   against an  external libmikmod.  Current
EGachine distributions ship  with  a statically linked CVS  version of
libSDL_mixer   because  this  module  depends  on   the Mix_LoadMUS_RW
function only available in newer versions.  Midi,  ogg and mp3 support
are disabled.

[libSDL_mixer -> libmikmod]
