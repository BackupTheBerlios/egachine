NOTE:

Perhaps  not all  EGachine  implementations will  use/support  OpenGL.
First  I did not want  to wrap OpenGL  because  EGachine should have a
simple API and should be simple to implement. On the other hand OpenGL
is available on many platforms  and has a  nice API (now there is also
OpenGLES for for the embedded space).

EGachine users have now the choice to use:
- the Video module (providing basic 2D-functionality)
- the sg module (depends on the Video module)
- the gl module directly
- the svgl module
