Input module

Description:

Module for handling keyboard, mouse and joystick / gamepad input. This
is a quite direct  mapping of the SDL event  handling.  SDL events are
converted to JavaScript objects.  For simplicity abstract gamepad like
devices  are  provided that are  either  real gamepads, joysticks used
like gamepads or   gamepads emulated by  keyboard.   To  use them  you
register   a    callback   via  the   Input.addDevListener   function.
Additionally you can get mouse events  similar to the  W3C DOM level 2
mouse events by  registering a callback via the Input.addEventListener
function.
