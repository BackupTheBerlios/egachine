io module (will replace stream module)

Objects:
ByteSource
ByteSink

May wrap:
- fd
- FILE*
- std::streambuf

Unfortunately I have problems with FILE* streams (stdio) and std::streambuf (c++ iostreams):
FILE*: no std way to get number of bytes available in input buffer?
std::streambuf (in fact std::filebuf): no way to create temporary files in a secure manner?

Others have similar problems:
- ruby (dropped stdio completely?)
- perl (PerlIO_get_cnt(PerlIO *))
- ...
