This is a modified version of jsolait <http://jsolait.net>,
modified to work with ejs.
Please do not bother the original author for bugs I introduced.

For now it does not fit well into ejs's framework.
(It introduces another module handling framework - a nice one btw.
perhaps I will modify ejs into a similar direction - though it might
be too restrictive)

I included it because of its JSON handling.
(It comes with a JSON parser and does not use eval => should be safe
if receiving JSON from untrusted sources).
EGachine will use JSON for secure client to server communication in
the future. (server->client will still use my own serializer)
