jsolait module

Description:

This is a modified version of jsolait <http://jsolait.net>,
modified to work with ejs.
Please do not bother the original author for bugs I introduced.

For  now it does  not fit well into   ejs's framework.  (It introduces
another module handling framework - a nice one) I  modified ejs into a
similar direction - but a bit less heavyweight  since to whole idea of
ejs is too keep it simple and keep the modules useable for peoples not
using ejs.

I included jsolait because of its JSON handling. It  comes with a JSON
parser that can be used to parse JSON from untrusted sources. EGachine
uses JSON  for  secure  client to server  communication.    (server to
client  communication is done via  Stream.ObjectWriter  which tries to
serialise JavaScript objects more precisely)
