ejs core does not allow multiple load/unload
unload is only done at shutdown and unload function may not use js functions

At the moment the ltdl module does better but relies on GC. (The finalizer does unload the module)
(it is stupid to force GC to do stuff - sometimes one should not depend on GC to free resources 
- s.a. java close methods in streams)

Another solution would be to keep track of the module load state
=> we would have one more indirection for function calls and functions could
always throw a "not anymore available exception" :-(

todo: think once more about it.

Is it really useful to unload and reload modules at runtime?
Especially since ejs might run on a platform supporting only static linkage anyway.

Use cases:
- replace module with newer version at runtime (see torcs bots)

One could also implement a proxy module on top of the current ltdl module implementing such stuff.
One could also allow to choose different implementations at runtime.
For now I keep this simple one.

add wrapper for
const lt_dlinfo * lt_dlgetinfo (lt_dlhandle HANDLE)
and perhaps some other ltdl functions
