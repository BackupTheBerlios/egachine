In fact this object allows the implementation/implements some kind
of a MOP. Operations on this object are interceptable in JavaScript 
itself by using and forwarding interception mechanisms present in 
the SpiderMonkey Interpreter.

The motivitation to do this was to allow an easy implementation
of object distribution (modifications in the object graph on one
host (the server) are distributed to the clients and the existent
JavaScript functionality (getter, setter, watch) is not enough
to do this.
