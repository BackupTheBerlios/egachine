This module provides the Monitorable object (constructor).

This  object  reflects  the SpiderMonkey hooks  for  adding, deleting,
getting and setting object properties back to JavaScript.  You can set
the special property "monitor" to  an object which may have properties
onAdd, onDelete, onGet and onSet set  to functions which are called if
the corresponding SpiderMonkey hook is called.

In       EGachine  this is       used  to  implement   the distributed
scene-graph. Modifications in the  object   graph on server side   are
automatically distributed    to  the   clients.    Existent JavaScript
functionality  (getter, setter, watch) is not  enough to do this since
you can't intercept property addition and removal.
