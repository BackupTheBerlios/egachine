svgl uses libgc garbage collector
it seems to work but i still should take a look at the details
(i think this will lead to trouble at some time)
hmm valgrind leakcheck doesn't work when loading svgl module

at the moment svgl is the owner of the native objects
wrapper objects are created on demand and may be garbage collected
then the wrapper object will vanish (with all its state not written through
to the native object => BUG)

the assumption is that the native object will always live longer than the
wrapper object (this assumption may be wrong, too)

must dom object constructors be in global scope?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
remove empty native constructors and finalizers if possible
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
scripting together with declarative animation?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
we dont support external script files:
<script xlink:href="foo.js" /> will not work
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dom level 2 event bubbling probably not correctly implemented
the reported coordinates are wrong?
