relocate may be called only once on each TCCState?
=> 1. create state
   2. compile*
   3. relocate
   4. execute*
   5. delete state
?


hmm - there is some trouble:

this works:
1. create state
2. compile*
3. relocate
4. execute*
5. delete state
6. goto 1

this does not work:
1. create state A
2. compile* A
3. relocate A
4. execute* A
5. create state B
6. compile* B
7. relocate B
8. execute* B
9. delete state A
10.delete state B


hmm yep
see tcc source code tcc.c:
	/* XXX: get rid of this ASAP */
	static struct TCCState *tcc_state;

TODO: Also take a look at other language bindings:

tcc and cc module should have the same interface
