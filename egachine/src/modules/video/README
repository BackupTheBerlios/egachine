Video module

Description:

provides basic 2D functionality.   The current implementation uses SDL
to setup the OpenGL context and the gl module for  the rendering.  The
API is  like a small subset   of the OpenGL  API in  2D.  Additionally
texture  loading is  simplified.   The purpose  of  this module  is to
provide a smaller base for the simple scene-graph  module (sg) to make
porting easier.  It should  not be too diffcult  to implement this API
using   a  traditional  2D    API.   (The   aplha-blending  might   be
problematic). For example  it should be possible  to write a pure  SDL
implementation (without OpenGL) or even   one based upon SVG  (perhaps
based on the svgl module)
